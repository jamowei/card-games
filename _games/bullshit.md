## Introduction

Bullshit is a card game that involves a lot of courage, deception, and trying to get rid of all the cards in your hand. It's also a lot of fun--just don't get caught in a lie! If you want to know how to master the game of "bullshit," just follow these steps.

## Preparation

 Shuffle and deal a deck of 52 cards. These should be evenly distributed amongst the players. Some of the players may end up with one more or fewer cards than the rest of the players, but that won't affect the outcome of the game in the long run. Before you begin, remember that the object is to get rid of all of your cards first. 3 or 4 players is the most ideal size for this game. Then determine how starts first.

## Play Game

The first player must start with an Ace (or several) and place it face-down on the table so none can see if it is true or not. Also he must tells the other players the type of card they just played. Like "One Ace", "two 2s" or "three Kings" and so on. Then the next player (clockwise) must put down a 2 (or several) in consecutive ascending order. For example, if the first player put down one or more Aces, the next player should put down one or more 2s, the third should put down 3s or more 2s, and so on. Ones it gets up to Kings (hightest card), it starts again by an Ace.

If you don't have the required card(s), you can play out a different one and pretend you played the correct one by announcing it (bluffing). If the next player places the next higher card on it, you got away with your lie and the game goes on. If the next player do not believe you played that correct card, he can call you a lier by yelling "bullshit". Then the played card gets revealed.

* If the card were right as announced by the player, the accuser have to take all of the cards in the pile.
* If the cards aren't what the player said, the lying player takes all the cards from the pile.

The player who takes the card (accuser or lier) ends his turn and the next player continue the game with the next higher number. As the game progresses, it will become more and more difficult to get away with lying during a round, especially if the amount of cards you have keeps decreasing.

## End Game

Once one person has played all the cards in their hand, they are the winner. Of course, most people would call "bullshit" on the last play of the game, but you can get around this by making your final play very subtly and quickly, or by calling "bullshit" on the person right before you in hopes of starting the next round.
