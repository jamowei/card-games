## Introduction

Dueling Nobles is a unique and strategic card game that contains far more depth than the standard gambling games typically played with 52 card playing decks. Jacks, Queens, and Kings are your prized fighters as they challenge your opponent’s nobles to sword duels in an effort to eliminate them from the game.
